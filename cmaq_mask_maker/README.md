Overview
--------

This notebook creates a time-independent file "mask" file. The values are
fractional and represent how much of the grid cell is contained within an
analysis area. These are useful for CMAQ DESID.

As an illustration, this notebook creates one file for Alabama and another
file using a custom definition around the "Four Corners" region.
